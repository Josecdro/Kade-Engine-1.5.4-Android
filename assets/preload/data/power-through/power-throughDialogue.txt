:K-2:Well, well, well. Look who it is.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/2
:K-1:Aren't you that pile of flesh I offed a while ago?
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/3
:K-3:HAHAHAHAHA! Oh, what a joy it is to run back into you, again!
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/4
:K-1:You and that damn demon ruined my life.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/5
:K-1:If you hadn't fucking moved that day, no one would've suffered, and I still would've been at heaven's door. Ugh!
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/6
:K-1:Oh, and the whore is here too.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/7
:K-1:My, my, are the gods giving me a sliver of grace today.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/8
:K-1:The two people who I want gone in the same spot, TOGETHER!

:K-1:Hm? Oh. Almost completely forgot you existed, midget.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/11
:K-1:What do you want, huh? You think I'm scared of you? Look at your brother.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/bb/Heart
:bb-17:...
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/12
:K-2:Your only protection is having his own mental problems, and you're not even on my kill list.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/13
:K-2:It's almost sad, seeing your brother look so helpless. I could, as an angel myself, spare him some grace and just..
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/14
:K-2:..put him out of his misery right here and now. I still have 13 rounds left in the chamber, I'd be doing him a favor.

:K-2:You want a what? A rap battle? ME?
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/16
:K-3:HAHAHAHAHAHA oh, no no no. I don't rap, however..
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/17
:K-2:..I will sing, and after I crush you, I'll take your brother, and girlfriend to where they belong. In hell.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/bb/4
:bb-6:Not... without... me.
:soundoverwritestop:
:enableTypeSound:
:bf-2:...B-Beep?
:disableTypeSound:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/bb/5
:bb-12:I'm afraid, but I'm not going to let him hurt you.
:soundoverwritestop:

:disableTypeSound:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/killer/18
:K-1:Hmph. Fine then, let's see how well you two sing. If you beat me, maybe I'll give you guys a few seconds to get away.. heh.
:soundoverwritestop:
:soundoverwrite:dialogue/powerthrough/bb/6
:bb-6:I.. I've not sang this type of music in a while. I'll try and keep up. We got this man! ..I hope.
